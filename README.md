<h3><a href="www.justjump.herokuapp.com">Just Jump!</a><h3>

<h5>Just Jump allows users to find their favorite foods at the right price point for them. The app is still a work in progress but currently has basic user functionality.
<br><br>
The application also has basic user-search statistics that will be a fragment of a larger algorithm tracking search data and providing suggestions to benefit the user.
<br><br>
Designed to provide ease of use on the client side, I aimed to re-factor the back-end as well to provide a better experience for the developer as well. There is still much re-factoring to be done, but those changes should be coming soon.
<br><br>
There were a lot of changes made near the end of the project's due time that should allow code to be cleaned up massively.
